# Flutter
A collection of basic Flutter studies and practice exercises.

This repository may contain multiple files, so only the Main Files will be uploaded.
To the files that require all the project folders, I'll organize so it can be downloaded :)

The first projects will all be static, which means that it won't have the Stateful Widget

Thank you for being here !
